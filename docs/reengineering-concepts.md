# Reengineering Concepts

Michael Hammer

Reengineering - the fundamental rethinking and radical design of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical; measures of performance (cost, quality, capital, service, speed).

## Keywords

* **Dramatic** - when you are five times away from your target state (not 5%)
* **Radical** - is not taking what we have and making it better---it is taking what we have and throwing it away---starting over---forget the past.
* **Processes** - group of activities or tasks that create value for a customer.

The only way to get dramatic improvement is to pay attention to processes.

Workers are rewarded on the end-to-end processes---use team approach:

* Look at the whole process
* Break rules, shatter assumptions
* Achieve dramatic improvements

Reengineering does not focus so much on units of work but how they fit together.

It is not what work gets done---it is who does it, where it is done, when it is done, in what order it is done, under what conditions it is done.

## What Changes

Jobs change---definition and scope of job has changed.
