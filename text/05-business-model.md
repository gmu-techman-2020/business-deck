# Business Model

Verkilo provides value via a mobilization platform business model. A platform business model creates value by supporting collaboration between two or more interdependent groups. A mobilization platform helps those groups foster long-term relationships to achieve common goals. This contrasts from an aggregation platform that keeps interactions transactional, such as Uber, and social platforms like Facebook and Reddit where the platform's focus is social. [@hagel_power_2015] Like other platforms, we do not create or manage inventory, although we do support content creation through the platform. Our focus is on the building working relationships between professionals. Our customers create and enhance the value of the creative products they produce.

## Services Offered

Verkilo will provide a comprehensive set of value-added customer services that will cater to our audience segments. These services include:

- **Content Creation.** Authors will experience a comprehensive rich-text interface for creating complex literary work products from short stories to multi-volume series. This created content will be securely stored in the cloud so the author can use any variant of our application (mobile, web, desktop) and enjoy a friendly user experience. Content creation includes storyboarding, outlining, and literary-element management.
- **Editorial Matchmaking.** When a work product is ready for editing, our machine-learning matchmaker will intuitively identify editing professionals with schedule availability that coincides with the product's release deadline to complete the edit on time without stress.
- **Editing and Version Control.** When a work product is being edited, our platform will provide the review, commenting and revision capabilities expected in industry. This includes tracking multiple revisions and changes between versions so collaborating parties can compare revisions.
- **Production-Ready Formatting.** When a work product is ready for distribution, our application will provide a professional, production-grade export of the product the author can then upload to their preferred distribution system such as Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing.
- **Community.** Our platform will encourage users to collaborate to improve their craft and marketability to their target audience.

## How the Service Will Work

Verkilo will facilitate professional self-published literature production, working as follows:

1. **Registration.** Anyone can browse the public portions of the web application. In order to create a work product as author or offer editorial services as editor, the customer will have to register with the application (web, mobile or desktop).
2. **Purchasing Services.** Authors can purchase freelance editors' editorial services via the application. Authors can solicit bids based on the matchmaking algorithm or respond to editor-directed bids.
3. **Selling services.** Freelance editors can bid on editorial services as requested by the author or as automatically identified by the matchmaker.
4. **Matchmaking.** Authors and editors will be matched via machine-learning algorithms that pair them via the work product's target audience, genre, and other criteria against the editor's self-identified preferences. Included in the matchmaking is a rating system that helps identify difficult users or editorial partners each party has enjoyed working with previously.
5. **Formatting.** Authors can export their work product in an automated print/electronic format that is distribution ready. This streamlines the creation process by using established templates that ensure a professional finish.
6. **Community.** Registered platform users in good standing will be encouraged to participate in our community experience using message boards, chats, etc. This will provide added value for the user and platform by improving matchmaking.

## Revenue Streams

Verkilo will build revenues and profits from the following sources:

- **Service Charge.** Verkilo will add a 10% service charge to the editorial bid with a minimum cost threshold based on the size of the work product and type of editorial service performed.
- **User Subscription.** Verkilo charges a nominal monthly user-subscription fee. The subscription drives retention-metrics collection.
