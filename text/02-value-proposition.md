# Value Proposition

Professional, publishable books without all the hassles

## Vision

Verkilo will create a fully integrated, content-creation platform to help self-published authors create professional-grade books by automatically pairing the author with available freelance editors using a machine-learning matchmaking algorithm. Self-published authors need to work with their supporting editor on a schedule that supports the author's targeted release date and the editor's hectic schedule. Verkilo is an application that works on any device wherever the author and editor are comfortable. Verkilo's unique value proposition removes friction from author and editor by automating the production process. This taps into a multibillion-dollar industry in need of optimization.

 Verkilo will build an Internet-based brand professionals in the self-publishing market will recognize as the leader in supporting production support offer professional-grade, self-published literature. Company revenue will be generated by a service charge added to each editorial transaction. Verkilo will develop and market its own product offering that leverages cloud technology and machine learning.

## Business Problem

The publishing industry is undergoing a transformation where traditional media is being displaced by self-published authors. This leads to a problem where the author as creator must also fill the role of product manager. The author must plan and coordinate all aspects of production from finding and scheduling editors and cover artists to formatting the final copy and handling distribution and marketing. This steals time and energy from the author's core role as the creative.

Likewise, freelance editors are frustrated by the challenges of scheduling and coordinating their work. They work directly with authors who are unfamiliar with the traditional publishing process and find themselves frequently managing authors' unrealistic schedule expectations and lack of professional discipline—often submitting manuscripts late and changing a draft after it has been submitted. This results in work-life balance complaints among freelance editors and lower-quality self-published books released to market. Authors and editors would rather focus on their respective specialties and not contend with the hassles of coordinating their work with one another. By solving this problem, we help self-published authors work more collaboratively with freelance editors on the editors' schedule. This improves the quality of books for the audience as well as work-life balance for editors, thus increasing earnings for author and editor.

## Solution

Verkilo helps authors and editors create professional, publishable books without all the hassles. We create a collaborative platform where authors and editors can work anywhere, any time by offering a cross-device application (web, Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, plugins).

Verkilo monitors the author's progress and creates a production schedule with editors who have similar audience and genre interests, and who are available to edit when the book is projected to be ready. When the author is ready to distribute, the book is professionally formatted into industry-standard file formats (PDF, ePUB). As 80% of self-published authors use Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), these formats are perfect for uploading directly to KDP for sale on Amazon. The American venture capital firm Sequoia describes American Express, PayPal, eBay, Uber, Facebook, WhatsApp, Netflix, and Amazon as two-sided platforms. [@sequoia_two-sided_2018] These platforms exist as intermediaries to match the supply and demand sides of a market efficiently.2 Verkilo compares to these companies in that it provides a similar two-sided marketplace for editors and authors.

## Validation

Validation of the problem and solution comprises market research in forums with high self-published-author and editor access. This includes Reddit's r/self-publish channel comprising 36,700 members [@noauthor_self_nodate] and the 20BooksTo50K® Facebook group comprising 35,800 members. [@noauthor_20booksto50k_nodate] We conducted an online survey of likely self-published editors via direct Facebook advertisement over a period of two weeks. These editors confirmed their biggest challenge was finding authors who had enough professionalism to work in the editor's schedule. This challenge directly affects the editors' quality of life and contributes most to editor frustration.
