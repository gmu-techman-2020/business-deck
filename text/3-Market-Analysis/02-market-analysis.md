## Market Size & Potential

Goal of the industry analysis section: Prove that there is a real market for your product or service.

Demonstrate the need – rather than the desire – for your product. Ideally, people are willing to pay money to satisfy this need.

Cite credible sources when describing the size and growth of your market.

* **Use independent research.** If possible, source research through an independent research firm to enhance your credibility. For general market sizes and trends, we suggest citing at least two independent research firms.
* **Focus on the "relevant" market size.** For example, if you sell a portable biofeedback stress relief device, your relevant market is not the entire health care market. In determining the relevant market size, focus on the products or services that you will directly compete against.
It’s not just a research report – each fact, figure, and projection should support your company’s prospects for success.
* **Don’t ignore negative trends.** Be sure to explain how your company would overcome potential negative trends. Such analysis will relieve investor concern and enhance the plan’s credibility.
* **Be prepared for due diligence.** It’s critical that the data you present is verifiable, since any serious investor will conduct extensive due diligence.
