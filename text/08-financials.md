### Financial Estimation Assumptions

Our financial plan operates on the following assumptions:

-   The historical trend in self-publishing continues for the
    foreseeable future.

-   There would be no unforeseen changes in technology to make our
    products obsolete. Our underlying software relies on JavaScript, a
    Top-5 programming language. We are leveraging well-established and
    well-supported AWS cloud technologies.

-   Cash flow is not expected to be a problem, with editing expenses
    being paid half on request, half on delivery and the service charge
    levied on request.

-   Verkilo's growth is based on internal financial resources. From year
    two forward, subject to growth requirements, the company will budget
    50% of after-tax profits for growth and 50% for dividends.

-   Verkilo's service fee is percentage-based, using industry standard
    editing prices.

-   Verkilo assumes authors and editors will continue to use the
    platform after establishing a relationship. We seek to maintain
    their platform engagement by providing a solid user experience.

## Revenue Streams

Verkilo will build revenues and profits from the following sources:

-   **Service Charge.** Verkilo will add a service charge to the
    editorial bid that is a fixed percentage of the bid with a minimum
    cost threshold based on the size of the work product and type of
    editorial service performed.

-   **User Subscription.** Verkilo charges a nominal monthly user
    subscription fee. The subscription drives metrics collection.

----------------------------------------------

-   **Developmental edit.** A thorough edit of a entire manuscript that
    reviews all the elements from single words and the phrasing of
    individual sentences, to overall structure and style**

-   **Copy Editing.** A general edit addressing grammatical and
    punctuation errors, incorrect facts, anomalies, inconsistencies and
    glaring typos.

-   **Proofreading.** A detailed edit to find all grammatical, spelling
    and punctuation errors.

-   **TBD: Fix the Revenue per user**

#### Service Fee Estimate Assumptions

-   Average manuscript length of 50,000, which is the industry-defined
    minimum size of a fiction novel. Manuscript length is traditionally
    based on genre ranging between 50-150,000 for fiction and
    non-fiction ranging up to 200,000 words.

-   A manuscript will probably go through multiple edit rounds, with the
    assumed probability reflected in the estimate.

## Financial Disclaimer

The financial projections that appear in this Business Plan are
estimated revenues, expenses, and cash flow, which are based on research
and the assumptions discussed throughout this Business Plan. They
represent the best of management's knowledge and belief. The Company's
expected revenues, expenses, and cash flow for the projected periods are
subject to the Company's ability to develop sales and production levels
at the price and costs estimated by management. Accordingly, these
projections reflect management's estimates as of date of publication,
and its expected course of action if such sales and production levels
are attained at the price and costs anticipated.

These projected financial statements are for the purpose of providing
updated information to existing and new investors. Do not consider these
projected financial statements as a presentation to forecast future
results. Accordingly, these projections may not be useful for other
purposes.

The assumptions discussed herein are those that management believes are
significant to the projections. There may be additional unconsidered
assumptions that could materially affect results. Furthermore, even if
the sales and production levels as well as the projected price and costs
are attained, there will usually be differences between projected and
actual results because events and circumstances frequently do not occur
as expected, and those differences may be material.
