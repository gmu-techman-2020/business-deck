# Customers & Marketing

Marketing is how Verkilo communicates with and reaches its customer segments to deliver its value proposition.

## Customer Segments

Verkilo's customer base falls into the following major segments:

- **Self-published Author.** The self-published author is either a full- or part-time author. The author is either being fully compensated for managing their own writing or dreams of doing so, and is working toward that goal. The 20BooksTo50K®
 group is an example of tens of thousands of authors working together to reach that goal. Our target author seeks to write more than one book per year, with an ideal rate being four to six books per year.
- **Freelance Editor.** The freelance editor is a full- or part-time editor. Like the author, the editor has or seeks full-time compensation for helping self-published authors convert their idea into a well-edited product. Some editors are also authors, but by and large, editors tend to congregate in the same online forums as authors or leverage discovery platforms like Reedsy to find their customers.
- **Freelance Artists.** The freelance artist is a full- or part-time artist interested in helping authors create professional-quality cover art. During our initial phase, our focus is on authors and editors to develop product-market fit. We will explore a pivot after we have fit to determine whether to target freelance artists in a subsequent phase.
- **Independent Publishing Companies.** Small-scale independent publishing companies are not part of the large conglomerates or multinational publication companies. These presses make up roughly half of the publishing industry. These companies offer editorial services and attract long-term relationships with published authors. While this segment is distinct from the self-publishing segment, allowing them to work with their authors and editors on a single platform to enrich the experience for their customers and employees. During our initial phase, our focus is on authors and editors to develop products that fit the market. We will explore a pivot after we have to determine whether to target independent publishers in a subsequent phase.

## Customer Engagement

#### Awareness

Verkilo seeks to acquire customers via the following means:

- **Conferences.** Create name and brand recognition by attending and or sponsoring national writing events such as NaNoWriMo and self-publisher-focused conferences. As an example of potential reach, NaNoWriMo had 1.05 million US members in 2019. [@noauthor_national_nodate]
- **Content Marketing.** Content marketing attracts prospects and transforms prospects into customers by creating and sharing valuable free content. Content marketing helps Verkilo create sustainable brand loyalty, provides valuable information to consumers, and creates a willingness to purchase products from us in the future.
- **Influencers.** Use well-known authors as influencers and public sponsors of the platform. This would include creation of educational video media, sample text documentation, and whitepapers on platform use-case.
- **Social Media Marketing.** Targeted digital marketing on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and various social media platforms with active users in our customer segments to increase name and brand awareness among self-published authors.
- **User Recommendations.** We incentivize our customers by giving them three subscription-free months for every new customer they recruit on platform who pays a minimum of three months.
- **Seven-Day Free Sign-up.** We conform to the SaaS market norm of providing no-commitment signups by offering a 7-day free signup that will roll over to a monthly subscription.

#### Evaluation & Delivery

Verkilo delivers its value proposition to its customers via:

- **Application Stores.** Verkilo will offer free downloads of its product accessible via the customer's preferred platform's app store (e.g. Apple Store, Microsoft Store, Google Play).
- **Verkilo Website.** Verkilo enables free downloads of its product directly from the website. It will also have a browser-based implementation allowing a user to work directly in their preferred browser.

#### Purchase

Verkilo's customers will purchase subscriptions through the Verkilo website.

#### After-Sales / Customer Relationships

Verkilo is a platform that seeks to establish a long-term indirect relationship with its customer segments. We seek to establish and maintain customer relationships via the following:

- **Initial Active Customer Service.** During the initial startup phase, Verkilo will provide online customer support to identify areas of product or documentation improvement.
- **Community for Shared Self-Service.** We seek to leverage our Community feature to allow users to share knowledge and solve each other's problems. We will moderate this community in the early stages.
- **Co-Creation.** We seek to use reviews to help users create value by helping one another identify high-quality professionals they can collaborate with.
- **Switching Costs.** We seek to ensure we are providing value by allowing authors to recover their manuscripts via exported Word (.docx) files. By giving them confidence they can switch, we hope to earn their trust. Allowing them to switch ensures we will strive to give them a product worthy of their use.
