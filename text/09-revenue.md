## Revenue Estimates

Verkilo will build revenues and profits from the following sources:

- **Service Charge.** Verkilo will add a service charge to the
    editorial bid that is a fixed percentage of the bid with a minimum
    cost threshold based on the size of the work product and type of
    editorial service performed.

- **User Subscription.** Verkilo charges a nominal monthly user
    subscription fee. The subscription drives metrics collection.

- **Developmental edit.** A thorough edit of a entire manuscript that
    reviews all the elements from single words and the phrasing of
    individual sentences, to overall structure and style**

- **Copy Editing.** A general edit addressing grammatical and
    punctuation errors, incorrect facts, anomalies, inconsistencies and
    glaring typos.

- **Proofreading.** A detailed edit to find all grammatical, spelling
    and punctuation errors.

- **Book Size** Edits are made based on total word count. The publishing industry minimum novel length is 50,000, our basis.

#### Service Fee Estimate Assumptions

-   Average manuscript length of 50,000, which is the industry-defined
    minimum size of a fiction novel. Manuscript length is traditionally
    based on genre ranging between 50-150,000 for fiction and
    non-fiction ranging up to 200,000 words.

-   A manuscript will probably go through multiple edit rounds, with the
    assumed probability reflected in the estimate.

## Financial Disclaimer

The financial projections that appear in this Business Plan are estimated revenues, expenses, and cash flow, which are based on research and the assumptions discussed throughout this Business Plan. They represent the best of management's knowledge and belief. The Company's expected revenues, expenses, and cash flow for the projected periods are subject to the Company's ability to develop sales and production levels at the price and costs estimated by management. Accordingly, these projections reflect management's estimates as of date of publication, and its expected course of action if such sales and production levels are attained at the price and costs anticipated.

These projected financial statements are for the purpose of providing updated information to existing and new investors. Do not consider these projected financial statements as a presentation to forecast future results. Accordingly, these projections may not be useful for other purposes.

The assumptions discussed herein are those that management believes are significant to the projections. There may be additional unconsidered assumptions that could materially affect results. Furthermore, even if the sales and production levels as well as the projected price and costs are attained, there will usually be differences between projected and actual results because events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected, and those differences may be material.
