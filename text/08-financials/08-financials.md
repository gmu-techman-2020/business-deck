Verkilo seeks $1.2 million in seed money for 18% in equity. All
investors are offered equity in the firm. Verkilo will invest the $1.2 million to fund product development, marketing, operational expenses,
execution of teaming/business agreements, and customer support. Our plan
anticipates delivering to market in the first year. As we progress into

Year 3, with an EBIT of $77,350.
