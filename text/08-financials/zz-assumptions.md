### Financial Estimation Assumptions

Our financial plan operates on the following assumptions:

-   The historical trend in self-publishing continues for the
    foreseeable future.

-   There would be no unforeseen changes in technology to make our
    products obsolete. Our underlying software relies on JavaScript, a
    Top-5 programming language. We are leveraging well-established and
    well-supported AWS cloud technologies.

-   Cash flow is not expected to be a problem, with editing expenses
    being paid half on request, half on delivery and the service charge
    levied on request.

-   Verkilo's growth is based on internal financial resources. From year
    two forward, subject to growth requirements, the company will budget
    50% of after-tax profits for growth and 50% for dividends.

-   Verkilo's service fee is percentage-based, using industry standard
    editing prices.

-   Verkilo assumes authors and editors will continue to use the
    platform after establishing a relationship. We seek to maintain
    their platform engagement by providing a solid user experience.
