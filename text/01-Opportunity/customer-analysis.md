## Customer Analysis

\Begin{multicols}{2}

Goal of customer analysis section: Convey the needs of your customers and show how your company’s products/services satisfy those needs.

Define your customers precisely. For example, it’s not adequate to say your company is targeting small businesses, since there are several million of these.

Detail their demographics. How many customers fit the definition? Where are these customers located? What is their average income?

Identify the needs of these customers. Use data to demonstrate past actions (X% have purchased a similar product), future projections (X% said they would purchase the product), and/or implications (X% use a product/service which your product enhances).

Explain what drives their decisions. For example, is price more important than quality?

Detail the decision-making process. For example, will the customer seek multiple bids? Will the customer consult others in their organization before making a decision?
