## Management Team & Gaps

Our management team comprises professionals with years of experience in providing cloud and software-development expertise. We are well-suited to bring Verkilo to market, though we seek additional expertise in marketing. Our team will be employed during the start-up period. We welcome expertise from our investor group that can contribute to the success of the company. We include management team skill gaps below.

#### Bryan Birchfield (Founder, CMO).

Bryan Birchfield has had an extensive engineering career with a wealth of experience as a systems engineer, solutions architect and network engineer. His experience has spanned business development, sales, product development, and engineering support teams.

#### Robert Koprowski (Founder, CTO).

Robert Koprowski is a senior IT solutions architect, systems administrator, and cybersecurity professional supporting various federal government clients. His 12 years of experience is diversified between migration, DevSecOps, and mobile application security within the cloud-computing industry for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. His passion for research and development (R&D) and delivering prototype programs is what drives him. Mr. Koprowski's expertise aligns well with bringing innovation to any startup.

#### Benjamin Wilson (Founder, CEO).

Ben Wilson is a senior government project manager. He has 17 years' experience in the technology field supporting efforts in software development, hardware, and organizational change management. He is the founding board president of the Accessible Community, a 503(c) nonprofit startup focused on improving access to small businesses, community organizations, and the surrounding communities for people with disabilities. As an aspiring self-published author, he is sensitive to the needs of the target audience.

#### Chief Financial Officer.

Verkilo lacks strong experience in financial planning and risk management. To mitigate this gap in expertise, we plan to outsource the entire accounting operation to CLA, LLP. CLA operates an entire business practice around offering outsourced accounting services, up to and including the CFO position, to small businesses and startups. This allows Verkilo to obtain the expertise required while keeping initial costs low.

## Company Ownership

Grown out of a desire to bring change to the self-published writing community, the management team (Birchfield, Koprowski, & Wilson) founded Verkilo in 2019 to bring an innovative mobilization platform to market. We are currently wholly owned and completely self-funded. To capitalize on our grassroots growth, Verkilo seeks a seed round of investment to establish product-market fit and product development.

## Risk Analysis

Verkilo accepts that, as a startup, it is a bundle of risks. Our risk-management approach looks at major aspects of a startup to determine how to fairly communicate those risks and explain how the company addresses those risks.

We use Leo Polovets' startup risk management model. [@polovets_how_nodate] As an angel investor and venture capitalist, Mr. Polovets suggests key aspects of a startup that should be de-risked. Each risk is scored on a Likert 1-5 scale (Very-High = 5, Very-Low =1). Focusing on systemic startup risk areas avoids a key mistake of undue resource allocation to address minor risks. [@polovets_startups_nodate]

The following list covers each of Polovets' suggested risk areas including our self-evaluation and approach to reducing risk. We leverage the approach recommended by Josh Smith, who created a risk-management process and spreadsheet from Mr. Polovets' model. [@smith_lower_nodate]

#### Product/Market Fit Risk---Very High

- Goal: Proving we are building what people want.
- Situation: We think people will use our product based on customer surveys and interviews.
- Mitigation: We will build our prototype in collaboration with early adopters, pivoting as needed to make fit. In this we follow in the footsteps of companies such as Google, Apple, and PayPal, who went from marginal to successful with a change of business model.

#### Product Quality Risk---Very High

- Goal: Proving we can build a high-quality product.
- Situation: We have no prototype, but we are sure we can build one.
- Mitigation: Build the prototype with seed funding using feedback from a small subset of our target audience.

#### Sales Risk---Very High

- Goal: Proving we can sell our product successfully.
- Situation: We have no sales experience.
- Mitigation: We seek an experienced sales/marketing advisor or co-founder to help us mature our capability.

#### Recruiting Risk---High
- Goal: Proving we can grow the team effectively.
- Situation: We have some recruiting experience, and specific team-building experience.
- Mitigation: We seek an experienced recruiting advisor or founder to help us mature our capability.

#### Short-Term Competition Risk---High
- Goal: Proving we are differentiated from others in the market space.
- Situation: There are many competitors that are inefficient at serving our target audience, but there is some differentiation between them.
- Mitigation: With sales in place, establish brand perception and seek a patent on our matchmaking technology.

#### Long-Term Competition Risk---High
- Goal: Proving defensibility, or that we can position ourselves to compete successfully against copycats.
- Situation: We do not have a real competitive advantage, but we are a first mover in automated professional relationship building between authors and editors.
- Mitigation: With sales in place, establish brand perception.

#### Intellectual Property Risk---High
- Goal: Proving we have protected intellectual property and are not at risk of litigation.
- Situation: We did a cursory patent and trademark evaluation but are not legally competent to do a proper patent search.
- Mitigation: Engage a patent law firm to guide us through the patent portion. Trademark Verkilo.

#### Market Risk---Low

- Goal: Proving we can execute well and become a successful company.
- Situation: We have conducted top-down market analysis, but not bottom-up analysis backed by experience and data.
- Mitigation: We will continue to improve our model via bottom-up analysis and experimentation.

\newpage

#### Team Risk---Low

- Goal: Proving we have a team that can achieve our vision.
- Situation: Our core team has technical competence in the key areas.
- Mitigation: None, minimal residual risk.

#### Funding Risk---Low

- Goal: Proving we have enough capital to hit our milestones.
- Situation: With effort, we should be able to break even without capital beyond the seed round.
- Mitigation: Seeking seed funding.

## Exit Strategy

Our exit strategy is acquisition by Amazon, which would enable full vertical integration within the KDP platform. Amazon would then own every aspect of the self-publishing production pipelineâ€”the ability to carry a self-published work from ideation through production to the reader. Our Technology section, _supra_, reflects this strategy by ensuring our application is ready to integrate easily into Amazon's application infrastructure.
