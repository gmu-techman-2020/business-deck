## Product / Market Research

The analysis of collected product interest and market penetration data
collected through the Verkilo.com website and Social Media platforms
supporting Verkilo's claims for business investment and growth
potential. (Tables / Figures / Graphs of Analysis) Below figures on
Product / Market Research were collected from Statista.com.

## Market Landscape Methodology

A market landscape quadrant provides a graphical competitive positioning
of four types of technology providers, in markets where growth is high
and provider differentiation is distinct:

-   **Leaders** execute well against their current vision and are well
    positioned for tomorrow.

-   **Visionaries** understand where the market is going or have a
    vision for changing market rules, but do not yet execute well.

-   **Niche Players** focus successfully on a small segment or are
    unfocused and do not out-innovate or outperform others.

-   **Challengers** execute well today or may dominate a large segment,
    but do not demonstrate an understanding of market direction.

## Verkilo Valuation Model

Verkilo used the Venture Capital method to identify its market valuation
after Seed investment. The Venture Capital method allows investors to
work backwards from their intended return, and calculate the value and
equity requirements of a particular deal.[^18]

Assumptions

-   We assumed a 15x multiple based off of our forecasted third-year
    post-tax earnings.

-   The IRR should be 30 percent year-on-year

-   \$2 Million in investor seed money, based on our request

-   25 percent dilution at Series-A, based on common venture capital
    estimates
