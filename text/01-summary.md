# Executive Summary

Traditional publishing offers a professional workflow that helps authors turn their creations into publishable products. The publishing field is competitive, resulting in a high author-rejection rate. The self-publishing market comprises one-third of the US publishing market, representing $9.1 billion of the $26 billion in gross US annual book revenue.

The quality of self-published titles is lower than traditional publishing due in part to a lack of professional editing, which, in turn, leads to a growing market of freelance editors. Authors and editors alike are challenged with finding a suitable counterpart who can work within their schedule. Editors are especially frustrated by authors with unrealistic expectations, which leads to lower quality-of-life and burnout in the editing community.

 Verkilo seeks to streamline the self-published author workflow through a two-sided platform where authors create their work and are automatically paired with a suitable editor for final collaboration. This will reduce friction in the production process for the author, and by assisting with scheduling we will improve our editor's quality of life. As a platform, we are like Airbnb and Uber. We generate revenue by levying a service charge on the author in addition to the editor's fees. By establishing a modest foothold in the self-publishing industry by Year 5, we expect to generate $REVENUE in revenue. Our ideal exit strategy is acquisition by Amazon.

 No unified, two-sided platform exists in the publishing industry that offers automated author/editor pairing with content creation and automated formatting. Most content creation and editing occur in standalone products like Microsoft Word and Google Docs. Existing pairing platforms like Reedsy rely on manual pairing. Other products in the industry focus on niche aspects such as formatting.

We seek $SEED-AMOUNT in seed money for $STAKE in equity so we can beat rivals to market and establish a strong brand presence. Verkilo will use seed funding to finance its first steps, including refined market research and product development. With seed funding, Verkilo can determine what its final products will be and who its target demographic is. We will use seed funding to employ a founding team to complete these tasks.
