# Market Analysis

Verkilo initially targets US self-published authors and editors. The US self-publisher market is one-third of the total US published market (itself a quarter of the global market) and is rapidly displacing traditional publishing conglomerates. The overall market should grow modestly for the foreseeable future, with US self-publishers potentially grossing between $9 and $28 billion in annual revenue by 2025. Our market landscape analysis reflects a diverse market of products and services that compete with Verkilo's vision for attention in the self-publisher market. However, our quantitative assessment suggests none are competing against our complete vision for hassle-free self-publishing.

## Market Size

The US book-publishing industry generated $28 billion in annual revenue in 2018. [@statista_book_2020] This represents 23% of the $119 billion in global annual revenue. [@noauthor_ibisworld_nodate] US self-published authors represent 35% of the US market, valued at $9.8 (or is it $7.8?) billion.

Bowker, the US registrar for ISBNs (International Standard Book Number), reported 1.6 million books published by self-published authors in 2018, including 490,000 new self-published titles released in 2018 with an assigned ISBN. [@bowker_news_nodate] From 2010 to 2018, the number of self-published book titles increased an average of 30% each year. [@bowker_self-publishing_2019] As the overall US market publishing market grew at a slower pace, this increase represents a displacement of traditional publishing by self-publishers. Forbes reported there were three self-published books for every traditionally published book as of 2017. [@pofeldt_new_nodate] Eighty-five percent of self-published books with ISBNs from 2013 to 2018—or 1.4 million titles—were distributed via Amazon's Kindle Direct Published Publishing (KDP), which replaced Amazon's CreateSpace. [@bowker_self-publishing_2019]

Bowker warned many books are now distributed via Amazon's Kindle and do not have ISBNs, which means the total number of self-published books exceeds the Bowker reported number. [@bowker_self-publishing_2019] We limited our analysis to verifiable numbers provided by Bowker.

Technavio,a leading market research company with global coverage, estimates the global publishing market size will grow by $23 billion to $142 billion between 2020-2024; a 19% percent increase over the next four years or 6% percent each year. [@technavio_publishing_nodate] The US market should grow at a similar pace to $33 billion. If self-publishing grows at the same rate, its market size will be $9.2 billion. If it grows at its 30% percent historic rate, its 2024 revenue may reach $27.9 billion: 85% of the total US publishing market. At 6% percent annual growth from Bowker's 2018 numbers, we estimate a total of 3.8 million self-published books will be released between 2020 and 2025. [@bowker_self-publishing_2019]

## Market Landscape

Our market landscape analysis shows a diverse market of products and services that compete with Verkilo's vision. Our market assessment aligns with the Five Forces as applied to software as a service (SaaS). [@annelise_porters_nodate] The competitive nature of this segment requires we establish a brand and product differentiation to stand out. Verkilo seeks to compete by having a complete vision of the production cycle and automating processes the competition leaves manual.

**New Entrant Threat---High.**The threat of new entrants in any SaaS-related market is high because the ease of establishing infrastructure and product is low. This is true despite barriers to gaining a foothold and remaining in the market long-term.

**Supplier Bargaining Power---Low**. Suppliers such as infrastructure providers have limited bargaining power due to the presence of many infrastructure and platform providers that have commoditized storage, computers, databases, and other services. Supplier costs are a small proportion of any SaaS company's expenses.

**Buyer Bargaining Power---Very High.** The competitive nature of SaaS markets results in companies giving significant information to the customer in the form of pre-sales information, free trials, and low-commitment, monthly rollover contracts. To succeed, Verkilo must establish brand loyalty and drive long-term value for the customer.

**Substitute Product Threat / Competitive rivalry---Very High.** SaaS companies like Verkilo live and die by product differentiation, which creates fierce competitive rivalry. We focus on competition separately due to the need to differentiate.

## Competition

To measure the market landscape, we leverage the methodology used by Gartner to quantitatively assess the market landscape. [@gartner_magic_nodate] Verkilo views four criteria essential in defining a complete vision for a self-publisher's platform. We measured each on a 5-point Likert scale and averaged the result results to get a vision index.

Frictionless user experience is a fifth criteria we believe is distinctive enough to be measured on a separate axis. See the Appendix for more detail on our analysis using this market landscape methodology and how we arrived at our metrics.

### Vision Criteria for a Self-Publishers Platform

1. **Complex Document Project Management.** Enables the self-published author to manage complex and interrelated documents (an entire fiction series or milieu for example)
2. **Intelligent Matchmaking.** Advances machine learning in automating the identification and collaboration of book-publishing professionals
3. **Professional Final Product.** Delivers a final product that is indistinguishable from traditionally published products
4. **Learning Community.** Draws self-published authors together to enhance the writing community and provide fine literature

The table below lists the top products in the self-publishing market that support content creation, revision, publication, or community. TBD- Appendix explaining why we scored each
