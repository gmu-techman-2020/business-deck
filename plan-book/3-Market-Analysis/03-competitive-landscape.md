## Competitive Landscape

Goal of the competitive analysis section: Define the competition and demonstrate your competitive advantage.

* **List competitors.** Many companies make the mistake of conveying that they have few or no real competitors. From an investor’s standpoint, a competitor is something that fulfills the same need as your product. If you claim you have no competitors, you are seriously undermining the credibility of your plan.
* **Include direct and indirect competitors.** Direct competitors serve the same target market with similar products. Indirect competitors serve the same target market with different products, or different target markets with similar products.
* **List public companies (when relevant, of course).** A public company implies that the market size is big. This gives the assurance that if management executes well, the company has substantial profit and liquidity potential.
* **Don’t just list competitors.** Carefully describe their strengths and weaknesses, as well as the key drivers of competitive differentiation in the marketplace. And when describing competitors’ weaknesses, be sure to use objective information (e.g. market research).
* **Demonstrate barriers to entry.** In describing the competitive landscape, show how your business model creates competitive advantages, and – more importantly – defensible barriers to entry.
