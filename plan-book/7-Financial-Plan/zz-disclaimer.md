## Disclaimer

The financial projections that appear in this Business Plan are estimated revenues, expenses, and cash flow, which are based on research and the assumptions discussed throughout this Business Plan. They represent the best of management's knowledge and belief. The Company's expected revenues, expenses, and cash flow for the projected periods are subject to the Company's ability to develop sales and production levels at the price and costs estimated by management. Accordingly, these projections reflect management's estimates as of date of publication, and its expected course of action if such sales and production levels are attained at the price and costs anticipated.

These projected financial statements are for the purpose of providing updated information to existing and new investors. These projected financial statements should not be considered to be a presentation to forecast future results. Accordingly, these projections may not be useful for other purposes.

The assumptions disclosed herein are those that management believes are significant to the projections. Furthermore, even if the sales and production levels as well as the projected price and costs are attained, there will usually be differences between projected and actual results because events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected, and those differences may be material.
