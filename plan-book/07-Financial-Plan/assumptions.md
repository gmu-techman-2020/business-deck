## Important Assumptions

The financial plan based on important assumptions, detailed in the following statements:

* Due to the initial limited production in comparison to the market size, Company assumes that even a slow-growth economy, will not affect our plan for the next five years.
* Company forecasts that there would be no unforeseen changes in technology to make our products obsolete. Pallet buyers are looking for cost effective solutions for replacing the high cost of purchasing, repairing, and discarding wooden pallets and RST-PAL pallets offer the solution by providing a longer lasting more durable pallet. 
* Cash flow is not expected to be a problem, with most pallets being paid for on delivery. There will be exceptions for specific customers, as an example, the U.S. Government, based on the quantity of pallets that are ordered, but generally, payments for pallets will be paid in full upon delivery.
* Company's growth is based on internal financial resources. Company will budget 50% for growth and 50% from the profits as dividends after taxes (from year two forward and as long as it does not affect the planned growth of the company). 
* The source of raw material (scrap tires) is virtually endless as long as cars continue to roll on tires. Presently, 250 million tires are added each year to  scrap tire stockpiles all over the country.
* Company assumes a short holding of inventory beyond the curing time of the pallets and transportation arrangements.
* Company assumes a 5% annual raise in our selling price, which is comparable to the wooden pallet industry and fluctuating lumber costs. 
* Company assumes no raise in our material costs, because the quantities we purchase will increase, and Company anticipates discounts to offset any increased costs.
* Company assumes an average sales price per pallet in the first year of production to be $18.50, which is significantly less costly than hardwood pallets whose entire cost includes purchase, repair, maintenance, and discard/disposal.
