## Operations Plan

\Begin{multicols}{2}

Goal of the operations plan: Present the action plan for executing on your company’s vision.

Concept vs. reality. The operations plan transforms the business plan from concept into reality. Investors do not invest in concepts; they invest in reality. And the operations plan proves that the management team can execute on your concept better than anybody else.

Everyday processes. Detail the short term processes and systems that provide your customers with your products and services.

Business milestones. Lay out the significant long-term business milestones for the company, and prove that the team will execute on the long-term vision. A great way to present the milestones is to organize them into a chart with key milestones on the left side and target dates on the right side.

Be consistent. Make sure that the milestone projections are consistent with the rest of the business plan – particularly the financial plan.

Be aggressive but credible. Presenting a plan in which the company grows too quickly will show the naiveté of the management team, while presenting too conservative a growth plan will often fail to excite an early stage investor (who typically looks for a 10X return on her investment).
