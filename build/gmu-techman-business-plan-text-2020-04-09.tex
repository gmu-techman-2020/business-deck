\hypertarget{executive-summary}{%
\chapter{Executive Summary}\label{executive-summary}}

Traditional publishing offers a professional workflow that helps authors
turn their creations into publishable products. The publishing field is
competitive, resulting in a high author-rejection rate. The
self-publishing market comprises one-third of the US publishing market,
representing \$9.1 billion of the \$26 billion in gross US annual book
revenue.1

The quality of self-published titles is lower than traditional
publishing due in part to a lack of professional editing, which, in
turn, leads to a growing market of freelance editors. Authors and
editors alike are challenged with finding a suitable counterpart who can
work within their schedule. Editors are especially frustrated by authors
with unrealistic expectations, which leads to lower quality-of-life and
burnout in the editing community.

Verkilo seeks to streamline the self-published author workflow through a
two-sided platform where authors create their work and are automatically
paired with a suitable editor for final collaboration. This will reduce
friction in the production process for the author, and by assisting with
scheduling we will improve our editor's quality of life. As a platform,
we are like Airbnb and Uber. We generate revenue by levying a service
charge on the author in addition to the editor's fees. By establishing a
modest foothold in the self-publishing industry by Year 5, we expect to
generate \$XX in revenue. Our ideal exit strategy is acquisition by
Amazon.

No unified, two-sided platform exists in the publishing industry that
offers automated author/editor pairing with content creation and
automated formatting. Most content creation and editing occur in
standalone products like Microsoft Word and Google Docs. Existing
pairing platforms like Reedsy rely on manual pairing. Other products in
the industry focus on niche aspects such as formatting.

We seek \$SEED-AMOUNT in seed money for \$STAKE in equity so we can beat
rivals to market and establish a strong brand presence. Verkilo will use
seed funding to finance its first steps, including refined market
research and product development. With seed funding, Verkilo can
determine what its final products will be and who its target demographic
is. We will use seed funding to employ a founding team to complete these
tasks.

\hypertarget{value-proposition}{%
\chapter{Value Proposition}\label{value-proposition}}

Professional, publishable books without all the hassles

\hypertarget{vision}{%
\section{Vision}\label{vision}}

Verkilo will create a fully integrated, content-creation platform to
help self-published authors create professional-grade books by
automatically pairing the author with available freelance editors using
a machine-learning matchmaking algorithm. Self-published authors need to
work with their supporting editor on a schedule that supports the
author's targeted release date and the editor's hectic schedule. Verkilo
is an application that works on any device wherever the author and
editor are comfortable. Verkilo's unique value proposition removes
friction from author and editor by automating the production process.
This taps into a multibillion-dollar industry in need of optimization.

Verkilo will build an Internet-based brand professionals in the
self-publishing market will recognize as the leader in supporting
production support offer professional-grade, self-published literature.
Company revenue will be generated by a service charge added to each
editorial transaction. Verkilo will develop and market its own product
offering that leverages cloud technology and machine learning.

\hypertarget{business-problem}{%
\section{Business Problem}\label{business-problem}}

The publishing industry is undergoing a transformation where traditional
media is being displaced by self-published authors. This leads to a
problem where the author as creator must also fill the role of product
manager. The author must plan and coordinate all aspects of production
from finding and scheduling editors and cover artists to formatting the
final copy and handling distribution and marketing. This steals time and
energy from the author's core role as the creative.

Likewise, freelance editors are frustrated by the challenges of
scheduling and coordinating their work. They work directly with authors
who are unfamiliar with the traditional publishing process and find
themselves frequently managing authors' unrealistic schedule
expectations and lack of professional discipline---often submitting
manuscripts late and changing a draft after it has been submitted. This
results in work-life balance complaints among freelance editors and
lower-quality self-published books released to market. Authors and
editors would rather focus on their respective specialties and not
contend with the hassles of coordinating their work with one another. By
solving this problem, we help self-published authors work more
collaboratively with freelance editors on the editors' schedule. This
improves the quality of books for the audience as well as work-life
balance for editors, thus increasing earnings for author and editor.

\hypertarget{solution}{%
\section{Solution}\label{solution}}

Verkilo helps authors and editors create professional, publishable books
without all the hassles. We create a collaborative platform where
authors and editors can work anywhere, any time by offering a
cross-device application (web, Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, plugins).

Verkilo monitors the author's progress and creates a production schedule
with editors who have similar audience and genre interests, and who are
available to edit when the book is projected to be ready. When the
author is ready to distribute, the book is professionally formatted into
industry-standard file formats (PDF, ePUB). As 80\% of self-published
authors use Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), these formats are
perfect for uploading directly to KDP for sale on Amazon. The American
venture capital firm Sequoia describes American Express, PayPal, eBay,
Uber, Facebook, WhatsApp, Netflix, and Amazon as two-sided platforms.
(Sequoia, 2018) These platforms exist as intermediaries to match the
supply and demand sides of a market efficiently.2 Verkilo compares to
these companies in that it provides a similar two-sided marketplace for
editors and authors.

\hypertarget{validation}{%
\section{Validation}\label{validation}}

Validation of the problem and solution comprises market research in
forums with high self-published-author and editor access. This includes
Reddit's r/self-publish channel comprising 36,700 members (\emph{Self
Published Writers}, n.d.) and the 20BooksTo50K® Facebook group
comprising 35,800 members. (\emph{20BooksTo50K®}, n.d.) We conducted an
online survey of likely self-published editors via direct Facebook
advertisement over a period of two weeks. These editors confirmed their
biggest challenge was finding authors who had enough professionalism to
work in the editor's schedule. This challenge directly affects the
editors' quality of life and contributes most to editor frustration.

\hypertarget{market-analysis}{%
\chapter{Market Analysis}\label{market-analysis}}

Verkilo initially targets US self-published authors and editors. The US
self-publisher market is one-third of the total US published market
(itself a quarter of the global market) and is rapidly displacing
traditional publishing conglomerates. The overall market should grow
modestly for the foreseeable future, with US self-publishers potentially
grossing between \$9 and \$28 billion in annual revenue by 2025. Our
market landscape analysis reflects a diverse market of products and
services that compete with Verkilo's vision for attention in the
self-publisher market. However, our quantitative assessment suggests
none are competing against our complete vision for hassle-free
self-publishing.

\hypertarget{market-size}{%
\section{Market Size}\label{market-size}}

The US book-publishing industry generated \$28 billion in annual revenue
in 2018. (Watson, 2019) This represents 23\% of the \$119 billion in
global annual revenue. (\emph{Global Book Publishing Industry Outlook},
2019) US self-published authors represent 35\% of the US market, valued
at \$9.8 (or is it \$7.8?) billion.

Bowker, the US registrar for ISBNs (International Standard Book Number),
reported 1.6 million books published by self-published authors in 2018,
including 490,000 new self-published titles released in 2018 with an
assigned ISBN. (\emph{News 2019 - Self-Publishing Grew 40 Percent in
2018, New Report Reveals}, 2019) From 2010 to 2018, the number of
self-published book titles increased an average of 30\% each year.
(``Self-Publishing in the United States, 2013-2018 Print and Ebooks,''
2019) As the overall US market publishing market grew at a slower pace,
this increase represents a displacement of traditional publishing by
self-publishers. Forbes reported there were three self-published books
for every traditionally published book as of 2017. (Pofeldt, 2019)
Eighty-five percent of self-published books with ISBNs from 2013 to
2018---or 1.4 million titles---were distributed via Amazon's Kindle
Direct Published Publishing (KDP), which replaced Amazon's CreateSpace.
(``Self-Publishing in the United States, 2013-2018 Print and Ebooks,''
2019)

Bowker warned many books are now distributed via Amazon's Kindle and do
not have ISBNs, which means the total number of self-published books
exceeds the Bowker reported number. (``Self-Publishing in the United
States, 2013-2018 Print and Ebooks,'' 2019) We limited our analysis to
verifiable numbers provided by Bowker.

Technavio,a leading market research company with global coverage,
estimates the global publishing market size will grow by \$23 billion to
\$142 billion between 2020-2024; a 19\% percent increase over the next
four years or 6\% percent each year. (``Publishing Market by Platform
and Geography - Forecast and Analysis 2020-2024,'' 2020) The US market
should grow at a similar pace to \$33 billion. If self-publishing grows
at the same rate, its market size will be \$9.2 billion. If it grows at
its 30\% percent historic rate, its 2024 revenue may reach \$27.9
billion: 85\% of the total US publishing market. At 6\% percent annual
growth from Bowker's 2018 numbers, we estimate a total of 3.8 million
self-published books will be released between 2020 and 2025.

2019)

\section{Market Landscape}\label{market-landscape}}

Our market landscape analysis shows a diverse market of products and
services that compete with Verkilo's vision. Our market assessment
aligns with the Five Forces as applied to software as a service (SaaS).
(\emph{Porter's 5 Competitive Forces for SaaS in 5 Minutes}, 2018) The
competitive nature of this segment requires we establish a brand and
product differentiation to stand out. Verkilo seeks to compete by having
a complete vision of the production cycle and automating processes the
competition leaves manual.

\textbf{New Entrant Threat.} ** High.**The threat of new entrants in any
SaaS-related market is high because the ease of establishing
infrastructure and product is low. This is true despite barriers to
gaining a foothold and remaining in the market long-term.

\textbf{Supplier Bargaining Power.}** Low**. Suppliers such as
infrastructure providers have limited bargaining power due to the
presence of many infrastructure and platform providers that have
commoditized storage, computers, databases, and other services. Supplier
costs are a small proportion of any SaaS company's expenses.

\textbf{Buyer Bargaining Power.}** Very High.** The competitive nature
of SaaS markets results in companies giving significant information to
the customer in the form of pre-sales information, free trials, and
low-commitment, monthly rollover contracts. To succeed, Verkilo must
establish brand loyalty and drive long-term value for the customer.

\textbf{Substitute Product Threat / Competitive rivalry.}** Very High.**
SaaS companies like Verkilo live and die by product differentiation,
which creates fierce competitive rivalry. We focus on competition
separately due to the need to differentiate.

\hypertarget{competition}{%
\section{Competition}\label{competition}}

To measure the market landscape, we leverage the methodology used by
Gartner to quantitatively assess the market landscape. (``Magic Quadrant
Research Methodology,'' 2020) Verkilo views four criteria essential in
defining a complete vision for a self-publisher's platform. We measured
each on a 5-point Likert scale and averaged the result results to get a
vision index.

Frictionless user experience is a fifth criteria we believe is
distinctive enough to be measured on a separate axis. See the Appendix
for more detail on our analysis using this market landscape methodology
and how we arrived at our metrics.

\hypertarget{customers-marketing}{%
\chapter{Customers \& Marketing}\label{customers-marketing}}

Marketing is how Verkilo communicates with and reaches its customer
segments to deliver its value proposition.

\hypertarget{customer-segments}{%
\section{Customer Segments}\label{customer-segments}}

Verkilo's customer base falls into the following major segments:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Self-published Author.} The self-published author is either a
  full- or part-time author. The author is either being fully
  compensated for managing their own writing or dreams of doing so, and
  is working toward that goal. The 20BooksTo50K® group is an example of
  tens of thousands of authors working together to reach that goal. Our
  target author seeks to write more than one book per year, with an
  ideal rate being four to six books per year.
\item
  \textbf{Freelance Editor.} The freelance editor is a full- or
  part-time editor. Like the author, the editor has or seeks full-time
  compensation for helping self-published authors convert their idea
  into a well-edited product. Some editors are also authors, but by and
  large, editors tend to congregate in the same online forums as authors
  or leverage discovery platforms like Reedsy to find their customers.
\item
  \textbf{Freelance Artists.} The freelance artist is a full- or
  part-time artist interested in helping authors create
  professional-quality cover art. During our initial phase, our focus is
  on authors and editors to develop product-market fit. We will explore
  a pivot after we have fit to determine whether to target freelance
  artists in a subsequent phase.
\item
  \textbf{Independent Publishing Companies.} Small-scale independent
  publishing companies are not part of the large conglomerates or
  multinational publication companies. These presses make up roughly
  half of the publishing industry. These companies offer editorial
  services and attract long-term relationships with published authors.
  While this segment is distinct from the self-publishing segment,
  allowing them to work with their authors and editors on a single
  platform to enrich the experience for their customers and employees.
  During our initial phase, our focus is on authors and editors to
  develop products that fit the market. We will explore a pivot after we
  have to determine whether to target independent publishers in a
  subsequent phase.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{customer-engagement}{%
\section{Customer Engagement}\label{customer-engagement}}

\hypertarget{awareness}{%
\subsection{Awareness}\label{awareness}}

Verkilo seeks to acquire customers via the following means:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Conferences.} Create name and brand recognition by attending
  and or sponsoring national writing events such as NaNoWriMo and
  self-publisher-focused conferences. As an example of potential reach,
  NaNoWriMo had 1.05 million US members in 2019. (\emph{National Novel
  Writing Month}, 2020)
\item
  \textbf{Content Marketing.} Content marketing attracts prospects and
  transforms prospects into customers by creating and sharing valuable
  free content. Content marketing helps Verkilo create sustainable brand
  loyalty, provides valuable information to consumers, and creates a
  willingness to purchase products from us in the future.
\item
  \textbf{Influencers.} Use well-known authors as influencers and public
  sponsors of the platform. This would include creation of educational
  video media, sample text documentation, and whitepapers on platform
  use-case.
\item
  \textbf{Social Media Marketing.} Targeted digital marketing on
  platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and various social media
  platforms with active users in our customer segments to increase name
  and brand awareness among self-published authors.
\item
  \textbf{User Recommendations.} We incentivize our customers by giving
  them three subscription-free months for every new customer they
  recruit on platform who pays a minimum of three months.
\item
  \textbf{Seven-Day Free Sign-up.} We conform to the SaaS market norm of
  providing no-commitment signups by offering a 7-day free signup that
  will roll over to a monthly subscription.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{evaluation-delivery}{%
\subsection{Evaluation \& Delivery}\label{evaluation-delivery}}

Verkilo delivers its value proposition to its customers via:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Application Stores.} Verkilo will offer free downloads of its
  product accessible via the customer's preferred platform's app store
  (e.g.~Apple Store, Microsoft Store, Google Play).
\item
  \textbf{Verkilo Website.} Verkilo enables free downloads of its
  product directly from the website. It will also have a browser-based
  implementation allowing a user to work directly in their preferred
  browser.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{purchase}{%
\subsection{Purchase}\label{purchase}}

Verkilo's customers will purchase subscriptions through the Verkilo
website.

\hypertarget{after-sales-customer-relationships}{%
\subsection{After-Sales / Customer
Relationships}\label{after-sales-customer-relationships}}

Verkilo is a platform that seeks to establish a long-term indirect
relationship with its customer segments. We seek to establish and
maintain customer relationships via the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Initial Active Customer Service.} During the initial startup
  phase, Verkilo will provide online customer support to identify areas
  of product or documentation improvement.
\item
  \textbf{Community for Shared Self-Service.} We seek to leverage our
  Community feature to allow users to share knowledge and solve each
  other's problems. We will moderate this community in the early stages.
\item
  \textbf{Co-Creation.} We seek to use reviews to help users create
  value by helping one another identify high-quality professionals they
  can collaborate with.
\item
  \textbf{Switching Costs.} We seek to ensure we are providing value by
  allowing authors to recover their manuscripts via exported Word
  (.docx) files. By giving them confidence they can switch, we hope to
  earn their trust. Allowing them to switch ensures we will strive to
  give them a product worthy of their use.

\hypertarget{business-model}{%
\chapter{Business Model}\label{business-model}}

Verkilo provides value via a mobilization platform business model. A
platform business model creates value by supporting collaboration
between two or more interdependent groups. A mobilization platform helps
those groups foster long-term relationships to achieve common goals.
This contrasts from an aggregation platform that keeps interactions
transactional, such as Uber, and social platforms like Facebook and
Reddit where the platform's focus is social. (Hagel, 2015) Like other
platforms, we do not create or manage inventory, although we do support
content creation through the platform. Our focus is on the building
working relationships between professionals. Our customers create and
enhance the value of the creative products they produce.

\hypertarget{services-offered}{%
\section{Services Offered}\label{services-offered}}

Verkilo will provide a comprehensive set of value-added customer
services that will cater to our audience segments. These services
include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Content Creation.} Authors will experience a comprehensive
  rich-text interface for creating complex literary work products from
  short stories to multi-volume series. This created content will be
  securely stored in the cloud so the author can use any variant of our
  application (mobile, web, desktop) and enjoy a friendly user
  experience. Content creation includes storyboarding, outlining, and
  literary-element management.
\item
  \textbf{Editorial Matchmaking.} When a work product is ready for
  editing, our machine-learning matchmaker will intuitively identify
  editing professionals with schedule availability that coincides with
  the product's release deadline to complete the edit on time without
  stress.
\item
  \textbf{Editing and Version Control.} When a work product is being
  edited, our platform will provide the review, commenting and revision
  capabilities expected in industry. This includes tracking multiple
  revisions and changes between versions so collaborating parties can
  compare revisions.
\item
  \textbf{Production-Ready Formatting.} When a work product is ready for
  distribution, our application will provide a professional,
  production-grade export of the product the author can then upload to
  their preferred distribution system such as Amazon's Kindle Direct
  Publishing.
\item
  \textbf{Community.} Our platform will encourage users to collaborate
  to improve their craft and marketability to their target audience.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how-the-service-will-work}{%
\section{How the Service Will Work}\label{how-the-service-will-work}}

Verkilo will facilitate professional self-published literature
production, working as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Registration.} Anyone can browse the public portions of the
  web application. In order to create a work product as author or offer
  editorial services as editor, the customer will have to register with
  the application (web, mobile or desktop).
\item
  \textbf{Purchasing Services.} Authors can purchase freelance editors'
  editorial services via the application. Authors can solicit bids based
  on the matchmaking algorithm or respond to editor-directed bids.
\item
  \textbf{Selling services.} Freelance editors can bid on editorial
  services as requested by the author or as automatically identified by
  the matchmaker.
\item
  \textbf{Matchmaking.} Authors and editors will be matched via
  machine-learning algorithms that pair them via the work product's
  target audience, genre, and other criteria against the editor's
  self-identified preferences. Included in the matchmaking is a rating
  system that helps identify difficult users or editorial partners each
  party has enjoyed working with previously.
\item
  \textbf{Formatting.} Authors can export their work product in an
  automated print/electronic format that is distribution ready. This
  streamlines the creation process by using established templates that
  ensure a professional finish.
\item
  \textbf{Community.} Registered platform users in good standing will be
  encouraged to participate in our community experience using message
  boards, chats, etc. This will provide added value for the user and
  platform by improving matchmaking.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{revenue-streams}{%
\section{Revenue Streams}\label{revenue-streams}}

Verkilo will build revenues and profits from the following sources:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Service Charge.} Verkilo will add a 10\% service charge to the
  editorial bid with a minimum cost threshold based on the size of the
  work product and type of editorial service performed.
\item
  \textbf{User Subscription.} Verkilo charges a nominal monthly
  user-subscription fee. The subscription drives retention-metrics
  collection.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{execution}{%
\chapter{Execution}\label{execution}}

Verkilo's execution plan focuses on ensuring we can provide our services
to our customer base when- and wherever they choose to write. We are
using traditional agile for development while we explore product-market
fit. We will maintain our infrastructure as code (IaC), allowing us to
better manage change and re-constitute our entire ecosystem
automatically. We will use GitHub for managing our code repository.
Customer Service will leverage a moderated community approach as
discussed in Customer Engagement, \emph{supra}.

\hypertarget{technology-solution-product-development}{%
\section{Technology Solution / Product
Development}\label{technology-solution-product-development}}

\hypertarget{summary.}{%
\subsubsection{Summary.}\label{summary.}}

We provide a multi-operating system application that supports literary
work product creation and collaboration based on a JavaScript (JS)
codebase. Several backend capabilities will leverage native Amazon Web
Service (AWS) cloud functions that provide on-demand capabilities.
Machine learning and performance analytics are provided through Amazon
SageMaker using PyTorch and GraphQL as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
within the AWS ecosystem of services.

Our service is comprised of the eight components listed below. Each
component provides value to the customer by providing a quality user
experience and a one-stop interface for developing a creative project
from any stage of the production process through to publication.

\hypertarget{composer-javascript-front-end.}{%
\subsubsection{Composer (JavaScript Front
End).}\label{composer-javascript-front-end.}}

The user interface (UI) is a cross-platform application written in
Node.JS, leveraging React, Redux, and other related libraries. The web
application provides a single code base for the other platforms written
entirely in JavaScript. We provide cross-platform support for mobile
(specifically Android and iOS) devices via React Native. We provide
desktop support via Electron. In addition, utilizing an integrated
plugin to Microsoft Word will provide support to all the development
spaces for authors and editors alike.

This UI provides a rich-text editor that can be used for composing,
editing, and commenting on the book project, leveraging UTF-8 for
multi-language support with multiple users able to collaborate in real
time. Author/editor interactions are managed on platform, with
active-push notifications. Editor-availability calendar is managed in
the composer.

\hypertarget{matchmaker-aws.}{%
\subsubsection{Matchmaker (AWS).}\label{matchmaker-aws.}}

The ``Matchmaker'' leverages predictive analytics (below) to help
anticipate when an author needs to seek out an editor. It offers the
author a set of editors identified by the audience and genre they edit
for, the type of editing they provide, and their expected availability.
This leverages AWS Lambda serverless Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) and
Docker containerization, and is written in a Python codebase. The UI for
this app will be equivalent to a Gig-search marketplace or Tinder's
swipe-right-or-left interface.

\hypertarget{data-store-aws.}{%
\subsubsection{Data Store (AWS).}\label{data-store-aws.}}

AWS AppSync will be used to implement GraphQL as a query language that
writes queries in an object structure over the standard text string.
This will greatly reduce the complexity of normal SQL queries between
the front end and backend, which will mean lower direct costs to run API
calls on AWS. As AppSync will be used as our API to handle requests from
our users and retrieve appropriate data, AWS DynamoDB will be used to
support the database services. DynamoDB is a serverless, NoSQL database
service on AWS that will auto-scale on its own and will easily integrate
with AppSync. To support the ``Matchmaker'' machine learning model, AWS
Elastic Container Service (ECS) will be used as the compute resource for
the integrated service offerings of Amazon SageMaker. This will ingest
the analysis and supporting data for testing, training, testing, and
bias/accuracy analysis to improve the machine learning algorithm. With
ECS, we will be using Docker as the container image repository as it is
already fully integrated into the ECS services. All customer proprietary
data will be encrypted with 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
symmetric encryption with private keys being managed through AWS Secrets
Manager key-paired through a user-only access/egress account policy.
This provides authors with a secure workspace for their projects while
also allowing them granular access-control rights to the intellectual
property to share with editors and the community at large.

\hypertarget{exporter-aws.}{%
\subsubsection{Exporter (AWS).}\label{exporter-aws.}}

The exporter converts the stored work into publication-ready formats
(PDF, EPUB, DOCX, RTF) and stores it on the author's selected cloud
storage (Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, OneDrive, Box, S3). This
conversion leverages Pandoc and LaTeX, with Lambda and Docker /
Kubernetes orchestration for the processing container.

\hypertarget{importer-aws.}{%
\subsubsection{Importer (AWS).}\label{importer-aws.}}

The importer converts uploaded RTF or DOCX into our proprietary format
for storage. The process leverages Pandoc and Docker / Kubernetes for
processing. We virus-scan these uploaded documents. As a milestone
event, we plan to implement and support a voice-to-text conversion of
uploaded MP3/4 and WAV using AWS Transcribe to provide convenience for
self-publishers to record thoughts and storytelling. Inherently, this
will also assist impaired users with any difficulties they may otherwise
encounter by self-publishing through standard means of writing and/or
typing their work. Additional support for this service includes Amazon
Textract (Text-Recognition), Amazon Translate (Language Translation),
and Amazon Polly (Text-to-Speech).

\hypertarget{account-management-aws.}{%
\subsubsection{Account Management
(AWS).}\label{account-management-aws.}}

User accounts will largely be managed by AWS Cognito, a service that
provides identity management and access control to our application.
Account creation, user/group management, MFA, device management,
password policies, and more will be managed through this service to
provide layered security and basic account management to our users.
Permissions/Rights will be managed in combination with a database table
and AWS Cognito groups. This will allow editors and authors to have
transparently different permissions and access to the same resources.

Cognito integrates with iOS, Android, Web, and desktop applications
without modification. Cognito will help the user to set these
permissions based on their Verkilo subscription (time until expired,
active/expired, etc.).

\hypertarget{notification-aws.}{%
\subsubsection{Notification (AWS).}\label{notification-aws.}}

To automate notifications to our users, as well as to administrators on
system-level events and monitoring, we're implementing AWS' Simple
Notification Service (SNS) in combination with AWS' Simple Email Service
(SES). SNS/SES is easily integrated into many of the other services AWS
offers, including Cognito. This will allow automated email messages to
be sent to users for account-creation directions, resetting passwords,
and subscription-renewal messages based on expiring subscriptions. These
services will also assist in security event information management,
automated incident response and recovery, and other logging/monitoring
needs for security-related capabilities implemented into our platform.

\hypertarget{predictive-analytics-machine-learning-aws.}{%
\subsubsection{Predictive Analytics / Machine Learning
(AWS).}\label{predictive-analytics-machine-learning-aws.}}

The data collected from editors and authors will include their schedule,
genre and audience preferences, and experience, which will serve as
inputs for the machine learning model. The model will then begin to
match similarities and ``chance of matching'' between the authors and
editors, which will serve as the output.

The data used to train the ``Matchmaker'' machine learning model will be
derived from data initially collected after Verkilo's release and until
it is implemented into the production environment. The data used to
train the ``Matchmaker'' will be a random 80\% of the collected data,
and the test/validation data set will comprise the remaining 20\%.

We will use Amazon's SageMaker Studio services to process over fifty
(50) industry-leading, optimized, ML-based models utilizing the top
three ML platforms (TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet), which are
the industry preferred frameworks for text-based input, linear
regression, reinforcement, and sentiment training. SageMaker Notebook,
Experiment, and Debugger will be directly integrated into AWS' machine
learning services, which will allow quick implementation and delivery of
our ``Matchmaker'' model and allow for a pipeline of additional data
analytics and derivations of platform service metrics.

\hypertarget{product-roadmap-development-path}{%
\section{Product Roadmap / Development
Path}\label{product-roadmap-development-path}}

Verkilo leverages a platform business model by bringing two different
market segments together. Our roadmap focuses on attracting both
segments to the platform with the goal of generating revenue principally
via the editor segment.

\textbf{Phase 1 - Composer} involves building the composer capabilities
and building out the infrastructure. During this phase, we will be
focusing more on the author than the editor to start adding editable
data to the platform. Early adopters will receive concierge scheduling
by the team while we build out the automated matchmaking \& scheduling.

\textbf{Phase 2 - Matchmaker} involves delivering the automated
matchmaking capability. We pilot the capability initially, replacing the
concierge scheduling as we gain confidence in the automation's ability
to schedule reliably.

\textbf{Phase 3 - Scale} expands the offering to a larger audience.

\textbf{Phase 4 -- Exit} involves seeking acquisition by Amazon.

\hypertarget{key-activities}{%
\section{Key Activities}\label{key-activities}}

Verkilo will engage in the following key activities to derive value for
our customers:

\textbf{Platform.} Verkilo's business model is dominated by its
platform. Activities supporting the platform relate to its management,
provisioning, and promotion.

\textbf{Author-Editor Coordinating.} Our key differentiator is our
ability to match author and editor based on a series of professional and
temporal criteria using machine learning and coordinating their
schedules automatically. We will manage these proprietary capabilities
as trade secrets and develop with a small core team.

\textbf{Product Development.} Verkilo is a cloud-based software product
company. That is the core of what we do.

\hypertarget{key-resources}{%
\section{Key Resources}\label{key-resources}}

\textbf{Platform.} Central to Verkilo's business model is its platform.
This includes the storage, security, privacy, and resiliency of our
customers' data, especially the work products produced by authors.
Securely storing this information is as important to us as it is to the
author.

\textbf{Physical.} Verkilo relies on no physical assets, with the core
team working from home.

\textbf{Intellectual Property.} Verkilo is primarily a company focused
on intellectual property.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Trademarks.} Verkilo is currently not trademarked according to
  the USPTO's TESS system. We will trademark Verkilo at the earliest
  opportunity.
\item
  \textbf{Patents / Trade Secrets.} We view our matchmaking algorithm as
  a trade secret rather than something patentable. This position may
  shift after consulting with a patent attorney.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Human.} Our core development team is key in developing our
algorithm. While we start with part of the team offshore, we onshore the
labor in favor of in-house developers as we gain our financial footing.

\hypertarget{key-partners}{%
\section{Key Partners}\label{key-partners}}

Verkilo relies on the following key partners to provide our service to
our customers:

\textbf{Amazon Web Services.} Verkilo uses a wide range of Amazon Web
Services to develop and deliver our services to our customers.

\textbf{Adreno Technologies India Pvt. Ltd.} Adreno Technologies (India)
Private Limited is one of the leading IT/ITES service providers in
India, delivering IT \& ITES Solutions to a diverse set of clients in
more than 20 countries across the globe. We partner with Adreno to lower
product-development costs to accelerate delivery to market.

\textbf{CLA LLP.} CLA is a professional services network and the eighth
largest accountancy firm in the United States. CLA LLP provides our
outsourced accounting support.

\hypertarget{company}{%

\hypertarget{management-team-gaps}{%
\section{Management Team \& Gaps}\label{management-team-gaps}}

Our management team comprises professionals with years of experience in
providing cloud and software-development expertise. We are well-suited
to bring Verkilo to market, though we seek additional expertise in
marketing. Our team will be employed during the start-up period. We
welcome expertise from our investor group that can contribute to the
success of the company. We include management team skill gaps below.

\hypertarget{bryan-birchfield-founder-cmo.}{%
\subsubsection{Bryan Birchfield (Founder,

founding board president of the Accessible Community, a 503(c) nonprofit
startup focused on improving access to small businesses, community
organizations, and the surrounding communities for people with
disabilities. As an aspiring self-published author, he is sensitive to
the needs of the target audience.

\hypertarget{chief-financial-officer.}{%
\subsubsection{Chief Financial
Officer.}\label{chief-financial-officer.}}

Verkilo lacks strong experience in financial planning and risk
management. To mitigate this gap in expertise, we plan to outsource the
entire accounting operation to CLA, LLP. CLA operates an entire business
practice around offering outsourced accounting services, up to and
including the CFO position, to small businesses and startups. This
allows Verkilo to obtain the expertise required while keeping initial
costs low.

\hypertarget{company-ownership}{%
\section{Company Ownership}\label{company-ownership}}

Grown out of a desire to bring change to the self-published writing
community, the management team (Birchfield, Koprowski, \& Wilson)
founded Verkilo in 2019 to bring an innovative mobilization platform to
market. We are currently wholly owned and completely self-funded. To
capitalize on our grassroots growth, Verkilo seeks a seed round of
investment to establish product-market fit and product development.

\hypertarget{risk-analysis}{%
\section{Risk Analysis}\label{risk-analysis}}

Verkilo accepts that, as a startup, it is a bundle of risks. Our
risk-management approach looks at major aspects of a startup to
determine how to fairly communicate those risks and explain how the
company addresses those risks.

We use Leo Polovets' startup risk management model. (Polovets, 2016a) As
an angel investor and venture capitalist, Mr.~Polovets suggests key
aspects of a startup that should be de-risked. Each risk is scored on a
Likert 1-5 scale (Very-High = 5, Very-Low =1). Focusing on systemic
startup risk areas avoids a key mistake of undue resource allocation to
address minor risks. (Polovets, 2016b)

The following list covers each of Polovets' suggested risk areas
including our self-evaluation and approach to reducing risk. We leverage
the approach recommended by Josh Smith, who created a risk-management
process and spreadsheet from Mr.~Polovets' model. (Smith, 2017)

every aspect of the self-publishing production pipeline---the ability to
carry a self-published work from ideation through production to the
reader. Our Technology section, \emph{supra}, reflects this strategy by
ensuring our application is ready to integrate easily into Amazon's
application infrastructure.

\hypertarget{financials}{%

Verkilo seeks \$2 Million in Seed funding for 10 percent equity. All
investors are offered equity in the firm. Verkilo will invest the \$2
Million to fund product development, marketing, operational expenses,
execution of teaming/business agreements, and customer support. Our plan
anticipates delivering to market in the first year. As we progress into
year 2 and beyond, our revenue from sales will cover our operational and
marketing expenses. We forecast that we will be net revenue positive in
Year 2, with an EBIT of TBD.

\hypertarget{fundraising}{%

\subsection{Financial Estimation
Assumptions}\label{financial-estimation-assumptions}}

Our financial plan operates on the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The historical trend in self-publishing continues for the foreseeable
  future.
\item
  There would be no unforeseen changes in technology to make our
  products obsolete. Our underlying software relies on JavaScript, a
  Top-5 programming language. We are leveraging well-established and
  well-supported AWS cloud technologies.
\item
  Cash flow is not expected to be a problem, with editing expenses being
  paid half on request, half on delivery and the service charge levied
  on request.
\item
  Verkilo's growth is based on internal financial resources. From year
  two forward, subject to growth requirements, the company will budget
  50\% of after-tax profits for growth and 50\% for dividends.
\item
  Verkilo's service fee is percentage-based, using industry standard
  editing prices.
\item
  Verkilo assumes authors and editors will continue to use the platform
  after establishing a relationship. We seek to maintain their platform
  engagement by providing a solid user experience.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{revenue-streams-1}{%
\section{Revenue Streams}\label{revenue-streams-1}}

Verkilo will build revenues and profits from the following sources:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Service Charge.} Verkilo will add a service charge to the
  editorial bid that is a fixed percentage of the bid with a minimum
  cost threshold based on the size of the work product and type of
  editorial service performed.
\item
  \textbf{User Subscription.} Verkilo charges a nominal monthly user
  subscription fee. The subscription drives metrics collection.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{financial-disclaimer}{%
\section{Financial Disclaimer}\label{financial-disclaimer}}

The financial projections that appear in this Business Plan are
estimated revenues, expenses, and cash flow, which are based on research
and the assumptions discussed throughout this Business Plan. They
represent the best of management's knowledge and belief. The Company's
expected revenues, expenses, and cash flow for the projected periods are
subject to the Company's ability to develop sales and production levels
at the price and costs estimated by management. Accordingly, these
projections reflect management's estimates as of date of publication,
and its expected course of action if such sales and production levels
are attained at the price and costs anticipated.

These projected financial statements are for the purpose of providing
updated information to existing and new investors. Do not consider these
projected financial statements as a presentation to forecast future
results. Accordingly, these projections may not be useful for other
purposes.

The assumptions discussed herein are those that management believes are
significant to the projections. There may be additional unconsidered
assumptions that could materially affect results. Furthermore, even if
the sales and production levels as well as the projected price and costs
are attained, there will usually be differences between projected and
actual results because events and circumstances frequently do not occur
as expected, and those differences may be material.

\section{Market Landscape
Methodology}\label{market-landscape-methodology}}

A market landscape quadrant provides a graphical competitive positioning
of four types of technology providers, in markets where growth is high
and provider differentiation is distinct:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Leaders} execute well against their current vision and are
  well positioned for tomorrow.
\item
  \textbf{Visionaries} understand where the market is going or have a
  vision for changing market rules, but do not yet execute well.
\item
  \textbf{Niche Players} focus successfully on a small segment or are
  unfocused and do not out-innovate or outperform others.
\item
  \textbf{Challengers} execute well today or may dominate a large
  segment, but do not demonstrate an understanding of market direction.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{verkilo-valuation-model}{%
\section{Verkilo Valuation Model}\label{verkilo-valuation-model}}

Verkilo used the Venture Capital method to identify its market valuation
after Seed investment. The Venture Capital method allows investors to
work backwards from their intended return, and calculate the value and
equity requirements of a particular deal.{[}\^{}18{]}

Assumptions

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We assumed a 15x multiple based off of our forecasted third-year
  post-tax earnings.
\item
  The IRR should be 30 percent year-on-year
\item
  \$2 Million in investor seed money, based on our request
\item
  25 percent dilution at Series-A, based on common venture capital
  estimates
\end{itemize}
